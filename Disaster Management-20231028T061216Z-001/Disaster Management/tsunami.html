                <p class="center">
                    Floods are the most common natural disaster in India. Here is a brief history of notable floods in India:<br>
1923, Lucknow: One of the earliest recorded floods in Lucknow's history, caused by heavy rainfall in the monsoon season, which made the Gomti River overflow its banks.<br>
October 1943, Madras (now Chennai): The city experienced its worst flood due to excessive rains that lasted for 6 days and overflowed Coovum and the Adyar rivers.<br>
17 October 1960, Lucknow: The flood was caused by the overflow of the Gomti River after heavy rainfall in the Himalayan region. It submerged almost half of the city under several feet of water.<br>
8 September 1971, Lucknow: The flood was caused by two breaches in the embankment of the Gomti River due to heavy rainfall in the monsoon season.<br>
Between 1980 and 2017, India experienced 235 floods, which led to 126,286 deaths and affected 1.93 billion people. The economic losses due to floods stood at a humongous $58.7 billion. Floods in India account for over 40 percent of the deaths out of all natural disasters.

1. Stay Informed:  Pay attention to weather forecasts and flood warnings from official sources like the National Weather Service. Sign up for emergency alerts if available in your area.<br> 
2. Have an Emergency Plan: Create a family emergency plan that includes a communication strategy and evacuation routes. Share this plan with your family members.<br> 
3. Prepare an Emergency Kit: Assemble an emergency kit with essential supplies such as non-perishable food, water, clothing, flashlights, batteries, a first aid kit, and important documents.<br> 
4. Elevate Electrical Systems: Elevate electrical outlets, switches, and circuit breakers to at least one foot above the expected flood level in your area.<br> 
5. Install Sump Pumps:  If you live in a flood-prone area, consider installing a sump pump in your basement to prevent water damage.<br> 
6. Raise Appliances: Elevate appliances like water heaters and furnaces to reduce the risk of damage from flooding.<br> 
7. Secure Hazardous Materials:  Store hazardous materials (like chemicals or pesticides) in elevated and secure locations to prevent contamination during flooding.<br> 
8. Move Valuables to Higher Ground: If possible, move valuable possessions to a higher floor or a safe, elevated location in your home.<br> 
9.Evacuate When Advised:  When authorities issue an evacuation order, leave your home immediately. Follow designated evacuation routes and go to a safe shelter.<br> 
10. Turn Off Utilities: If time permits and it's safe to do so, turn off gas, electricity, and water before leaving your home.

                <h2 class="h-secondary center">Don'ts</h2>
                <p class="center">
1. Don't Ignore Warnings: Take flood warnings seriously. Even minor flooding can cause significant damage and pose risks to your safety.<br> 
2. Don't Drive Through Flooded Areas: Avoid driving or walking through flooded streets and underpasses. Just a few inches of fast-moving water can sweep you off your feet or stall your vehicle.<br> 
3. Don't Wait to Evacuate: If an evacuation order is issued, don't wait until the last minute to leave. Delaying your departure can put your life at risk.<br> 
4. Don't Touch Electrical Equipment: Avoid contact with electrical equipment, appliances, and outlets if you are in a flooded area or if you suspect water damage.<br> 
5. Don't Enter Flooded Buildings: Do not enter your home or any other building that has been flooded until it has been declared safe by authorities.<br> 
6. Don't Drink Floodwater: Floodwater can be contaminated with sewage and other pollutants. Do not use it for drinking, cooking, or personal hygiene.<br> 
7. Don't Ignore Emergency Alerts: Stay updated on weather and emergency alerts through official channels. Avoid spreading unverified information or rumors.<br> 
8. Don't Isolate Yourself: Stay connected with friends and family, especially if you are in an evacuation shelter or a safe location.<br> 
9. Don't Ignore Signs of Hypothermia: In cold floodwater, be aware of the signs of hypothermia and take steps to warm up if you experience them.<br>
