                An earthquake is like when the Earth gets a big shake. This happens because the Earth's surface is made up of large pieces called tectonic plates. These plates are always slowly moving.

Ancient Understanding
Earthquakes were thought to be caused by “air vapors in the hole of the Earth” or due to tension between the earth and water. Some also believed that a cycle of dryness and wetness or water itself caused seismic activity.
<br>Religious Interpretations
In various cultures, earthquakes were attributed to gods or mythical creatures. For instance, in Norse tales, they were seen as the struggle of the god Loki. In Greek mythology, Poseidon was believed to cause earthquakes. In Japanese folk tales, a giant catfish named Namazu was thought to cause earthquakes.
<br>Modern Understanding
Today, we understand that earthquakes are primarily caused by the movement of tectonic plates. Other causes include volcanic eruptions, cave formations, or explosions. Recent studies also suggest that global warming could be contributing to an increase in seismic activity.
<br>One of the most devastating earthquakes in recorded history was the 1556 Shaanxi earthquake, which occurred on 23 January 1556 in Shaanxi, China. More than 830,000 people died. Most houses in the area were yaodongs—dwellings carved out of loess hillsides—and many victims were killed when these structures collapsed. The 1976 Tangshan earthquake, which killed between 240,000 and 655,000 people, was the deadliest of the 20th century.</p>

                <h2 class="h-secondary center">Dos</h2>
                <p class="center">
1. Drop, Cover, and Hold On: If you are indoors during an earthquake, drop to the ground, take cover under a sturdy piece of furniture (such as a table), and hold on until the shaking stops.<br>  
2. Stay Indoors: If you are inside a building, stay there. Do not run outside, as falling debris can be dangerous.<br> 
3. Stay Away from Windows: Glass can shatter during an earthquake, so move away from windows to avoid injury.<br> 
4. Brace Heavy Items: Secure heavy objects and furniture to prevent them from falling or tipping over during an earthquake.<br> 
5. Stay Calm: Try to remain as calm as possible during the earthquake. Panic can lead to poor decision-making.<br> 
6. Protect Your Head and Neck: If you can't find shelter, protect your head and neck with your arms.<br> 
7. If You Are Outdoors:  Move away from buildings, streetlights, and utility wires. Find an open area and drop to the ground.<br> 
8. If You Are in a Vehicle: Pull over to a safe location away from overpasses, bridges, and buildings. Remain inside the vehicle until the shaking stops.<br> 
9. After the Quake: Check for injuries and administer first aid as necessary. Be prepared for aftershocks, which can follow the main quake.

                <h2 class="h-secondary center">Don'ts</h2>
                <p class="center">
1. Don't Run Outside: Running outside during an earthquake can expose you to falling debris and hazards. Stay indoors if you are already inside a building.<br> 
2. Don't Use Elevators: Avoid using elevators during or immediately after an earthquake. They may become stuck, or the power could fail.<br> 
3. Don't Stand Underneath Heavy Objects: Avoid standing or taking cover under heavy objects, such as chandeliers or bookshelves, as they may fall.<br>                   
4. Don't Light Flames: Do not light matches, candles, or open flames, as gas leaks can occur during an earthquake.<br> 
5. Don't Use Your Phone Unnecessarily: Keep phone lines clear for emergency calls. Use text messages or social media to communicate if necessary.<br> 
6. Don't Drive: Avoid driving if possible, as the shaking can make it difficult to control a vehicle. Pull over to a safe location and remain in the vehicle until the shaking stops.<br> 
7. Don't Spread Rumours: Do not spread unverified information or rumours about the earthquake. Rely on official sources for updates.<br> 
8. Don't Enter Damaged Buildings: Avoid entering buildings that have visible structural damage. They could collapse further.<br> 
9. Don't Re-enter Buildings Quickly: Wait until it's safe before re-entering buildings to retrieve belongings. Structural damage might not be immediately apparent.
